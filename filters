Filters implemented in the ixo React Web App and React Native Mobile App MUST be specified in JSON-LD syntax.
This will enable semantic linking across filter configurations.

User story:
As a Project Creator who works across multiple sectors, I want to be able to filter for the available Project Templates in each domain. Regardless of which Relayer Portal I use, I want to know that I am using the same filter categories (both in name and meaning).

Filter categories SHOULD adhere to standard public schemas for filters.
The ixo schema server will be hosted (in the first instance) by ixo.foundation. 
This context will therefore be "@context":"https://schema.ixo.foundation/project"
In future, the 'schema server' can use IPFS to achieve global persistence, content addressing and immutibility.

A snippet of the JSON-LD for a single filter category for "SDG" and included goal of "Education" would look something like:

{
  "@context":https://schema.org
  "@type":"Project"
   @context": "https://schema.ixo.foundation/project",
  "@type": "Category",
  "SDG": {
    "@type": "Goal",
    "@id": "SDG4",
    "name": "Education"
  },
